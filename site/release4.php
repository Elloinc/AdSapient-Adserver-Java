The new version of AdSapient has two valuable modifications which makes it indespensable for industries with multiple advertised products. These changes are plugin management system for connecting to different banner ad content providers and template-driven banner creation process for smart ad view optimization.
AdSapient Personalized Ads is a new ad serving framework developed by AdSapient Inc. for automatic optimizion of banner ad content and ad view to match each user's preferences and advertising context.</i><br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In traditional classical targeting scheme the audience is shaped by targeting filters such as geo and content thus dramatically decreasing the number of potentials. As a result of such practice publishers have to sell large cheap inventories in bulk. Such web site traffic is also known as run-of-site or run-of-network.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from traditional targeting options the AdSapient targeting scheme offers optimized banner ad display which increases the number of potentials by diversifying advertised product and streamlining the purchasing process. <br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of ad personalization and product diversification the number of potential product buyers is increased as well.
The publisher's inventory can be sold for a higher price, because targeted campaigns have higher value for advertisers.  Advertisers are interested in potentials increase as well and ready to pay higher CPM and CPC price for that.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from personalizing ad content you can also diversify its view for web surfers by using a template-driven banner creation process implemented in AdSapient. As the publisher's inventory varies in ad place size and type (regular, popup, email, etc.), advertisers have to create different ads of each size and for each advertising context. Sometimes they just skip the trouble and content themselves with one or two most popular ad sizes. <br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AdSapient offers standard ad templates as well as the option to create your own templates. With one banner ad content stored in a XML file you can assign numerous XSLT templates that will be used for banner display. Templates can refer to different resources such as images, text files, media files uploaded to the server.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By diversifying the ad view the advertiser reaches higher user response since the same or similar offers presented in a different way to the same user statistically have stronger impact.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of cases when advertisers can use AdSapient personalized ads for higher campaign efficiency. It should be noted though that it is more reasonable to use this technology when the advertised product is represented by a whole series of similar items. Below is a list of possible applications:
<li>e-tourism: product - tour offer; tour offer can be personalized according to visitor location, language, field of interest, income, gender, family status  (if available);</li>
<li>e-shopping: product - any shopping item;</li>
<li>real estate: product - any realty;</li>
<li>software catalog;</li>
<li>mortgage and financing products;</li>
<li>e-dating.</li>
